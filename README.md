This Solidity smart contract, MessageBoard, creates a simple, on-chain message board where users can post messages. Only the contract owner can delete messages. The contract inherits from OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract, which provides basic ownership and access control functionality.

Key Components
State Variables
MessageId: A uint256 variable that acts as a counter for the total number of messages posted.

messages: A dynamic array of Message structs that stores all the messages.

Message: A struct that defines the properties of each message:

author: The address of the user who posted the message.

message: The string content of the message.

timeStamp: The timestamp of the block when the message was posted.

Functions
constructor()
The constructor initializes the contract by setting the owner to the address that deploys the contract. This is done through the Ownable contract's constructor.

PostMessage(string memory \_content)
This public function allows anyone to post a message.

It first checks if the message content, \_content, is not empty. If it is, it reverts with an InvalidMessage error.

It then increments the MessageId counter.

It appends a new Message struct to the messages array, storing the sender's address (msg.sender), the message content, and the current block's timestamp.

Finally, it emits a MessagePost event with the author's address, message content, and timestamp, which can be useful for off-chain applications to track new posts.

DeleteMessage(uint256 \_messageId)
This function allows the contract owner to delete a message. The onlyOwner modifier ensures that only the contract owner can call this function.

The function takes an integer \_messageId as input, which corresponds to the MessageId of the message to be deleted.

It validates the input \_messageId to ensure it is within the valid range of the messages array. If not, it reverts with a MessageNotFound error.

This function does not actually delete the specific message at the given \_messageId. Instead, it uses a gas-efficient technique to remove an element from a dynamic array. It replaces the element at the specified index with the last element in the array and then pops the last element off. This is a common pattern to avoid a costly array shift.

It emits a MessageDelete event with the owner's address and the ID of the message that was intended to be deleted.

getMessageCount()
This public view function returns the total number of messages in the messages array.

It reverts with a MessageNotFound error if there are no messages.

getMessages(uint256 \_messageId)
This public view function retrieves a single message by its ID.

It takes a uint256 \_messageId as input and returns the author, message content, and timestamp of the corresponding message.

It includes validation to ensure the provided ID is valid, reverting with MessageNotFound if it is not.

It's important to note that since arrays in Solidity are 0-indexed, the function accesses messages[_messageId - 1].

getAllMessages(uint256 \_startingMessage, uint256 \_lastMessage)
This public view function returns a batch of messages.

It takes a starting index \_startingMessage and a number of messages to return \_lastMessage.

It returns an empty array if \_startingMessage is out of bounds.

It calculates the correct total number of messages to return, adjusting if the requested range goes beyond the available messages.

The function iterates from the end of the messages array backwards, collecting a specified number of messages. This is designed to get the latest messages first, which is often a desired feature for a message board.
